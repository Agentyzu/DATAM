# DATAM Algorithm
Python code for implementing a DATAM algorithm

# What does this do?
The DATAM algorithm presents a Double Auction-based Task Allocation Mechanism, which can achieve distributed allocation of tasks and bandwidth among multi-UAV.

# How do I use this?
Check out `config.ini` for the input specification. Following that example, we create a text file that lays out the initialized properties.

Then run the Python code. If you are running Linux, this is super easy. Change to the directory and:

    $ ./main.py

This will also work (and maybe even work on Windows/OSX?):

    $ python3 main.py

If you are using Pycharm or IDLE or whatever else, you can double-click to open `main.py` and run it directly.
